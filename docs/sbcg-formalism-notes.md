# SBCG Formalism Notes For Inference

These notes summarize the parts of Sag (2012), *Sign-Based Construction Grammar: An Informal Synopsis*, used by Feature Structure Studio's first SBCG-aware inference layer.

The goal is not to make the app guess lexical content. The app should infer the formal scaffolding that follows from a typed feature-structure signature: appropriate features, inherited feature domains, and expected value shapes. In implementation terms, Sag's grammar signature is the schema layer consulted by the editor.

## Core Modeling Commitments

Sag treats the grammar signature as the place where the ontology of the grammar is declared. A type declaration associates a feature-structure type with a domain of features and assigns each feature an appropriate value type. This is the central design pattern for the inference layer: type names determine feature suggestions.

SBCG distinguishes:

- **Signs**: linguistic objects such as words and phrases.
- **Constructs**: local mother-daughter trees licensed by combinatoric constructions.
- **Listemes and constructions**: grammar-side descriptions that license classes of signs or constructs.

The app therefore separates three things:

- the user's structured JSON feature structure
- the SBCG schema that suggests appropriate features
- the LaTeX exporter that renders the result

## Sign Geometry

Sag's sign synthesis gives the core sign features:

- `PHON : phon-obj`
- `FORM : morph-obj`
- `SYN : syn-obj`
- `SEM : sem-obj`
- `CNTXT : context-obj`

For the app, the Section 3 `sign` schema fills these five features, with values left underspecified or structurally shaped. `PHON` and `FORM` are represented as empty lists in the MVP because Sag treats their internal details as mostly outside the chapter's focus.

## Lexical Signs, Words, Lexemes, And Phrases

Sag's hierarchy makes `lex-sign` a subtype of `sign` with:

- `ARG-ST : list(expression)`

`word` inherits both expression properties and lexical-sign properties. So typing `word` and invoking inference fills the sign features plus `ARG-ST`. `phrase` inherits sign/expression properties but does not add `ARG-ST`.

The app does not fill `ARG-ST` with `NP` values automatically. Sag uses examples such as intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbal lexeme classes, but those are lexical-class constraints and must be selected or supplied by the user or a future lexical-class preset.

## Syntax Object Geometry

Sag defines `SYN` as a `syn-obj`. Section 3 introduces three core features:

- `CAT : category`
- `VAL : list(expression)`
- `MRKG : mark`

So typing `SYN` or `SYNTAX` into a blank feature row infers a nested `syn-obj` AVM with those features. `GAP`, `WH`, and `REL` are noted as further syntax-object features in Section 3, but the chapter discusses them later; they should be treated as advanced/nonlocal extensions rather than default Section 3 syntax geometry.

## Category Geometry

Sag treats `CAT` values as feature structures of type `category` and gives category subtypes such as `verbal`, `verb`, `complementizer`, `nonverbal`, `nominal`, `noun`, `prep`, `adj`, and `adv`.

The app currently models:

- `category`: `SELECT`, `XARG`, `LID`
- `verbal`: inherits `category`, adds `VF`, `IC`
- `verb`: inherits `verbal`, adds `AUX`, `INV`
- `noun`: inherits `nominal`, adds `CASE`

This lets users type `verb` as a type and fill the appropriate category features without inventing actual values.

## Semantics Geometry

Sag's `SEM` object is flat rather than recursively embedded in the ordinary semantic-composition sense. Section 3 gives:

- `INDEX : index`
- `LTOP : label`
- `FRAMES : list(frame)`

So typing `SEM` or `SEMANTICS` into a blank feature row infers a nested `sem-obj` with those features. `FRAMES` remains an empty list until the user supplies frame information. The shorter `IND` spelling appears in examples and appendices, so the app accepts it as an alias of `INDEX`.

## Context Geometry

Sag's Section 3 context object includes:

- `C-INDS : contextual-index`
- `BCKGRND : list(proposition)`

`C-INDS` expands to:

- `SPKR : index`
- `ADDR : index`
- `UTT-LOC : index`

## Constructs

Sag models constructs as local trees:

- `MTR : sign`
- `DTRS : nelist(sign)`
- `CXT-CONTENT : list(frame)`

The app can suggest these fields for a `construct`. It currently represents `DTRS` as an empty list placeholder, even though the formal value type is nonempty, because creating actual daughter signs would be contentful and should be user-driven.

## MVP Inference Boundary

The inference layer may add:

- missing features appropriate to a type
- inherited features from supertypes
- nested AVMs for known feature value types
- empty lists or underspecified placeholders for expected list/set/value positions

The inference layer must not guess:

- concrete argument values such as `NP`
- lexical identifiers or frames
- actual `PHON` or `FORM` content
- semantic indices, labels, or role fillers
- construction-specific daughter configurations

This boundary keeps the app useful without quietly pretending to know lexical or constructional commitments that Sag's formalism leaves to listemes, lexical-class constructions, and combinatoric constructions.
